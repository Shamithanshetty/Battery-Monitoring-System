# Battery-Monitoring-System
This project presents the development of an IoT-based Battery Monitoring System utilizing the ESP8266 microcontroller, to monitor the charging/discharging status, battery voltage, and 
percentage. The system aims to address the critical need for monitoring battery health, particularly in applications where improper charging/discharging can lead to damage or system failure. Traditionally, Battery Management Systems (BMS) have been utilized for this purpose, but with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, remote monitoring have become feasible. The proposed system leverages the ESP8266's capabilities to send battery status data to the Ardino cloud platform, allowing users to remotely monitor the battery status via smartphones or computer dashboards from anywhere in the world. By providing real-time 
monitoring and alerts, this system enhances safety, prolongs battery life, and ensures the reliable operation of devices powered by lithium-ion.
